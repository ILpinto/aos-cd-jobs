A new Sprint is beginning and the Continuous Delivery team may need to reach out to a member of your team to analyze issues during our cluster upgrades.

Please update the "Support Assignments" cards on the Continuous Delivery Hub [1] trello board for this Sprint. Continuous Delivery will reach out to the identified resource(s) directly when the need arises. To assign a resource:
- Visit the trello board: https://trello.com/b/BLLIoSsG/continuous-delivery-hub .
- Find your team's card in the "Support Assignments" List [2].
- Add the identified resource as member of the team card. 
- Remove the previous Sprint's member.

The team member(s) identified:
    - Should join the following IRC channel for the duration of the Sprint: #aos-devops .
    - Will automatically be added to cards requiring support from your team.
    - Must be able to prioritize issues and questions related to Starter clusters over all other work.
    - Should rapidly respond to help requests from the Operations, SRE, or CD team to support production and non-production clusters. 
      - Help requests will originate through IRC or the trello board.
      - This response may need to include Bluejeans sessions to aid in discussion / live analysis of cluster issues. 
    - Can capture their thoughts on the upgrades here [3].
    - Should contact jupierce with any concerns or questions related to this responsibility.

Thanks,
- The OpenShift Continuous Delivery Bot
